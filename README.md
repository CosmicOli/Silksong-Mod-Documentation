# Silksong-Mod-Documentation
A repository for planning multiple mods and how they would interact.

# Structure
To begin with, I will keep my planning and progress within this readme, but I intend to section this off more formally later.

# Quick and Dirty Randomiser Project
As of current, 15/02/2026, the team behind Hollow Knight's [RandomizerMod](https://github.com/homothetyhk/RandomizerMod) have not yet ported their work to Hollow Knight's sequel, Hollow Knight Silksong.

There does exist an [item randomiser](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/Someone_Else/HKS_Item_Randomizer/) already, however instead of using a 'logic' system to prevent being hardlocked from game progression, it uses a pity system. In my personal experience with the mod, I also found it did not randomise certain major item pickups, although I am unsure if that was instead caused by mod conflicts.

I wish to not just play silksong with items randomised, but also have a randomiser that is compatible with [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg). I hence intend to implement an arbitrary item replacer along with a 'logic' system that is compatible with archipelago, all before next Sunday, 22/02/2026, where me and some friends are intending to do an archipelago run together.

Considering that I am in full time education with 2 assignments due this week, I do not have full confidence in my ability to produce this within a week. This is my first time modding a game, although thankfully I do have experience with C# and Unity from prior education and projects. Either way, I'm giving it a shot.

# Log 2
I have written a [vague initual outline](/Notes/Vague%20Initial%20Outline.md) of the mod interaction structure. It's not good or well researched, but it's a start.

More importantly, I have written a [more fleshed out document](/Mod%20Information/Item%20Replacer.md) with useful information and design principles regarding the Item Replacer. I hesitate to call it a design document due to a lack of specificity and consistency in what I wrote, but it does mostly outline the point of the mod.

I won't lie, I feel like definitely took longer than it needed too, but at the very least I feel somewhat more resolute in how specifically I plan on implementing an item replacer. If I was not so short on time, I would do the same for the rest of the planned mods and then write a comprehensive and specific list of features and functions and how they should interact. I may end up doing so later, but right now I must tidy my room lmao
